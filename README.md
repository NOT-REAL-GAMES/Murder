3.  **A group of crows.**

### Murder is an editor for Bevy, built in ~~Bevy~~ a custom build of Bevy with minute changes. 

It is intended to be made ~~in accordance with the design principles laid out in [the design document](https://bevyengine.github.io/bevy_editor_prototypes/) made by the official Bevy team.~~ Disregard that: the design principles are a bit undecided as is as I prioritize trying different approaches to make a usable editor.

# FAQ

### Will this be uploaded to crates.io?

Short answer: *very* unlikely on my watch.

This is because Murder is meant to be an independent foundation that is in pretty much every way complementary to Bevy, yet remains a separate project for a single-executable game engine that is designed to be as accessible as possible.

As such, we believe it's in the best interest of all parties involved that it stays separate from the registry, so as to give the impression that the end product of the game engine is the executable produced by the framework, rather than the framework itself.

### So is this like the Bevy equivalent to Redot?

This project is (and will forever be) completely dependant on Bevy as it has been from the start. The Murder team commends Godot's decision, and hopes this sets a standard for more game companies to stand for egalitarianism, be it internally or societally.

### Are you delusional?

As a matter of fact, I do have delusions of grandeur, but I can assure you it will not affect this project in any way.
