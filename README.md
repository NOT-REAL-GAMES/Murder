# FAQ

### Will this be uploaded to crates.io?

Short answer: *very* unlikely on my watch.

This is because Murder is meant to be an independent foundation that is in pretty much every way complementary to Bevy, yet remains a separate framework for a single-executable game engine that is designed to be as accessible as possible, and as such, I would prefer that it stays separate from the registry, so as to give the impression that the end product of the game engine is the executable produced by the framework, rather than the framework itself.
